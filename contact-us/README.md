## Introduction

In this project, we have implemented a minimalistic web application that incorporates the following technologies:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We use React components to create reusable and modular UI elements.

- **HTML:** The standard markup language for creating the structure of web pages.

- **CSS:** The style sheet language used for presenting the layout and design of web pages.

The project serves as an excellent starting point for beginners who want to get hands-on experience with these technologies and learn how they work together to build a simple web application.
